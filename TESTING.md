### Client stories testing:

Most common path through the website: 
- Home > Personal Training > Group Training> Get in Touch 
- The user will be brought to the Home page be default. There is a call to action button which brings them straight to Personal Training as this is where LN Fitness wants to increase demand.  
  Depending on the user, they may want to find out About LN Fitness or get more information on the Group Training page. Whichever service the user is looking for, all are directed to the Get in Touch page.
